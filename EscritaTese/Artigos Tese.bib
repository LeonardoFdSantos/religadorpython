	abstract = {In the existing model of total supply capability, the low-voltage side buses are totally ignored. The connection was described as the feeder link from transformer to transformer. It leads to two incorrect considerations in calculation based on this model，which obviously produce errors. In this paper, a method applying equivalent bus is proposed to reformulate the model of total supply capability. Firstly, the supply transfer process after a transformer failure in actual operation was analyzed to clarify the consideration of this work, and proposed the equivalent bus; Secondly, through examples and inferences, the stable connection between equivalent bus and transformer was revealed. Thirdly, a new model of total supply capability was proposed based on the stable connection of equivalent bus, which considered the constraint of the low-voltage buses. Finally, the new model was tested in a simple distribution system with three substations, and a solution of building up the connection between equivalent bus and transformer was introduced. As the results, the calculation based on this model proposed the supply capabilities of transformers and substations, and the load distributions of buses, equivalent buses and feeders, which conclude a total error of 0.34\% of the total supply capability.},

This paper presents a study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of using distribution bus voltages as a metric for evaluating grid health considering widespread public {EV} charging. Using the Caldera software and distribution network models created with the {OpenDSS} modeling software, the effect of {EV} charging on the grid power distribution network has been studied in this work. The {IEEE} 34-bus system and a distribution network in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah {USA} are used as study cases in the work. The results of the study are time-series voltage data at select buses on each network. Analysis of the results and comparison of the studies show voltage violations can occur on the {IEEE} 34-bus system due to public electric vehicle charging loads, but no violations were observed in the actual grid power distribution network in downtown Salt Lake City. Based on the case study results, analysis, and comments, insights have been provided in this paper to further discuss the effectiveness of using distribution bus voltages alone as the metric for grid health. Through the analysis, case studies, and system simulations, this paper concluded that distribution bus voltages alone may not be a sufficient metric in determining grid health considering widespread public electric vehicle charging.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach by means of Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) for fault classification and detection in the {IEEE} 34 bus system, which serves as a representative model for distribution networks. The {IEEE} 34 bus system is known for its complexity, featuring multiple buses, branches, and loads, making it an ideal testbed for evaluating advanced fault management techniques. The proposed {CNNbased} methodology leverages the ability of {CNNs} to automatically learn hierarchical features from system data, such as voltage and current measurements, without the need for manual feature extraction. The key contributions of this paper include the development and implementation of a {CNN} architecture tailored for fault classification and detection tasks in the {IEEE} 34 bus system. The {CNN} model is trained using labeled data sets containing information about different fault scenarios, including 1-phase, 2-phase, and 3-phase faults. The training process involves optimizing the network parameters to improve accuracy and robustness in fault identification. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the {CNNbased} approach in accurately classifying and detecting faults in the {IEEE} 34 bus system. The {CNN} model shows high accuracy rates in distinguishing between different fault types and provides rapid response times for fault detection, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and resilience of the distribution network. The implications of this research extend to the broader context of intelligent fault management systems in power engineering. By harnessing the capabilities of {CNNs}, power system operators can benefit from more efficient and automated fault management processes, leading to improved system performance, reduced downtime, and enhanced grid reliability.},

The transportable battery energy storage systems ({TBESSs}) have also gained interest recently due to their mobile nature and the possibility to provide power storage services at different locations. However, some analysis must be provided in order to evaluate the impact on the distribution system depending on the {TBESSs} allocation. Among the possible outcomes, this paper aims to investigate the inﬂuence of {TBESS} on shortcircuit characteristics of a typical distribution system.

Integrating biomass-powered distributed generators ({BDGs}) can enhance network performance by reducing losses and improving voltage profiles. However, improper placement of these {BDGs} can lead to significant issues. In order to reduce active power loss in the network, this study uses the new Harris Hawk's Optimizer Algorithm ({HHOA}) to calculate the ideal placements and sizes of single and multiple {BDGs}. The analysis takes into account a number of scenarios, such as voltage variation mitigation, active power loss minimization, and multi-objective problem-solving, and it is centered on the {IEEE} 34-bus radial distribution system ({RDS}). Additionally, the impact of different power factors on biomassbased {DGs} is investigated. A comprehensive comparison with existing optimization techniques is conducted, and statistical assessments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for integrating {BDGs} into {RDS}.},

These events, power quality disturbances, cause several losses for both the concessionaire and its consumers, either by damaging appliances or interrupting their operation. Among these power quality disturbances, the voltage sag stands out for being the most frequent event, causing several losses. Therefore, it is extremely important to locate the source of these disturbances in the electrical distribution system, in order to mitigate the problem. In general, methods for locating disturbances use few electrical meters and an analysis of the characteristics of voltage and current signals, which results in the estimation of a large region as a result. This paper proposes a approach to ﬁnd not a region, but the bus in the power distribution system in which the voltage sag disorder originated by using a model of deep learning.},

The existing threephase state estimation ({SE}) models only involve the measurement characteristics of the {HWM}. Instead, a set of new and improved measurement equations are formulated in this article for such buses measured by {TWM}, and the measurements include line-toline complex power and virtual zero-sequence current. Along with the increasing underground cable, the neutral point of {MV} feeder head is normally grounded through a small resistance, and its voltage magnitude is not equal to zero. Accordingly, an accurate model for the slack bus together with its measurement equations is proposed herein, based on the conventional measurements and neutral point virtual measurement. Moreover, this work presents a three-phase {SE} model for {MV} and {LV} distribution systems that incorporates the constraints of zero-sequence current and zero injection, in combination with the exponentially weighted least squares ({EWLS}) method. The test results of the {IEEE} 34 bus system and {IEEE} 123 bus system verify that the proposed formulation takes full advantage of the measurements and structural characteristics of practical distribution networks and simultaneously boosts the estimation accuracy.},

The effects of system strength are evaluated considering Tasmanian power system and {IEEE} 14 {BUS} system. The integration of {AG} reduces system strength, while the other two generations have a negligible impact on system strength. Hence, it is crucial to address the {AG} integration issues for ensuring system stability.

From the protection point of view, this philosophy can be applied mainly in feeders that contain a large number of protection devices in series, which results in long operating times and exposure to fault currents, especially in devices further upstream in the feeders, with using conventional protection philosophies. Pilots of this new philosophy were applied, which presented satisfactory and even surprising results (in cases of broken cables), thus, resulting in a rollout process of this philosophy in about 400 other devices protection in the utility grid, presenting good scalability due to possibility of its application in all models of {IEDs} of reclosers and circuit breakers of the utility that are found on the market.

The proposed index is calculated at the relays using local measurements. The faulted section is isolated using the communicated information between the relays. In case of communication failure, decision is taken using locally calculated index and a coordinated operation of relays is also ensured during breaker failure to provide backup protection.

	abstract = {Renewable resources are mostly interfaced to the grid through inverter systems with dictated behavior during shortcircuit faults depending on the manufacturer design and specifications. The unconventional short-circuit behavior of inverter-based resources ({IBR}) challenges the conventional protective functions, causing spurious tripping for some external fault conditions and no tripping for some internal faults. An approach to alleviate the {IBR} protection issues is to develop new protective functions compatible with the fault response of {IBRs}. However, in a transmission system with high penetration of {IBRs}, many protective relays throughout the grid could be affected so that replacement of a large number of conventional relays is not practically feasible. Rather, it is economically beneficial to design the control system of {IBRs} so as to mimic the fault behavior of a conventional synchronous machine. This paper presents a current reference controller for the full-converter {IBRs} to utilize the maximum current capability of the inverter power-electronic switches while emulating the incremental sequence current magnitudes of a conventional synchronous generator. Conducting simulation studies in the {PSCAD}/{EMTDC} program, it is shown than the proposed method is well capable of achieving the mentioned goal for all fault types.},

Typically, line-currentdifferential relaying is used for primary protection and then, when communication is lost, the differential relays are backed up by distance relays. However, in presence of {WTGs}, distance protection is highly prone to misoperation. Therefore, this paper proposes a protection scheme that uses a loss-of-potential overcurrent logic for {OWF} export cables as an alternative backup protection. For this study, an experimental setup was created using a real-time digital simulator and physical relays to evaluate the performance of the proposed protection scheme using hardware-in-the-loop testing. Test results showed that the proposed scheme operated correctly under different types of faults and fault locations.},

The mis-coordination problems between {OverCurrent} Relays ({OCRs}) and zones of Distance Relay ({DR}) in transmission lines are one of the causes of blackouts globally. In particular, the overreach of Zone-2 in {DR}, which can result in undesired Zone-2 operation. The proposed mixed coordination strategies between overcurrent and distance protection schemes in this paper can overcome such problems in distribution systems.

The analysis is based on worst-case assumptions derived from field cases and published findings, it avoids modeling by using proprietary and uncertain information about the sources, and it does not assume that the source fault response complies with any local, international, present, or pending interconnection standards. The paper identifies parts of the distance element logic that do not work well in applications near unconventional sources and replaces the problematic parts with alternatives that perform satisfactorily. The solution is based on an offset distance characteristic to avoid memory polarization. It further uses separate directional elements to directionalize the offset distance elements by taking advantage of the system fault current contribution rather than the source current contribution.},

	abstract = {Distance protection elements face security problems during power-swing conditions because the swelling power may cause the apparent impedance to encroach on the element operating characteristics. To address this problem, line distance protective relays include a power-swing blocking logic to secure their distance elements during power swings. Avoiding undesired line tripping keeps the transmission network intact and gives the system time to stabilize through inherent transient stability margins and dedicated transient stability schemes, including load and generation shedding, power system stabilizers, and remedial action schemes. From the protection perspective, however, assertion of the power-swing blocking logic hurts protection dependability during power-swing conditions. Symmetrical faults that cannot be detected by using sequence directional elements in a pilot protection scheme are of particular concern. To maintain protection dependability during power swings, it is desirable to remove the power-swing blocking signal for faults that occur during power swings, especially for three-phase symmetrical faults. Characteristics of power swings continue to change as more unconventional low-inertia sources are added to the power system. These sources are modulated by their control algorithms rather than by the inertia of the rotating masses and synchronous machine torques. This paper presents a power-swing blocking and out-of-step tripping logic suitable for systems with low inertia. The presented logic does not require settings and derives its operating parameters from the basic line parameters and distance protection settings. As a result, application of the presented logic does not need transient stability studies. The logic presented in this paper has been implemented and deployed in the field since 2020.},

It is essential to study and compare the recloser's pick-up activity and operation time before setting the recloser in an active distribution system. This study, therefore, develops a virtual single-shot reclosing scheme and its performance tested in a passive and active distribution system. Matlab/Simulink/Simscape power systems environment is used to simulate cases. Simulations are conducted for four case studies to identify issues in the performance of the recloser when there is distributed generation.

	abstract = {The power system protection plays a decisive role in defending the power system from damages that might be incurred due to faults by fault identification, isolation and clearance. In this work, the power system protection has been analyzed for a transmission line equipped with a phasor measurement unit ({PMU})-based auto-recloser. A Petri net ({PN}) model is used to exemplify the qualitative performance measures of the protection system model through behavioural properties such as conservativeness, reachability, properness, safeness, and boundedness. Thereafter, the {PN} model developed has been extended for an ideal transmission line protection system to derive failure scenarios in protection system that result due to three of its important components: relay, circuit breaker and auto-recloser device. The failure analysis is necessary for yielding appropriate solutions to failures, improving system design, introducing a new device to aid the system functionality, and aiding the recovery process, which eventually leads to a more reliable system. Therefore the sole aim of this paper is to provide accurate modeling for the failures to alleviate the process of power system protection.},

The first approach combines linear programming with particle swarm optimization. The second approach combines linear programming with genetic algorithms optimization. The analysis considers two 20 {kV} radial distribution systems with {DG}, applying different network protection schemes: (i) solely based on directional overcurrent relays, and (ii) based on a typical recloser-fuse combination. In the first case, optimal coordination between the positive/negative/zero-sequence directional overcurrent elements of the network relays and the voltage-dependent overcurrent elements of the {DG} unit relays is considered. In the second case, optimal coordination between the latter and the reclosers is achieved, also considering the nonsettable fuse characteristics. The simulation results show that both algorithms are quite robust and give a very low total tripping time for each test system considered.},

The existence of distributed generation sources affects the short circuit level and disrupts the distribution network's recloser-fuse coordination. Using a fault current limiter in series with distributed generating sources is one solution to this problem. The fault current limiter is employed in this paper to restore recloser-fuse coordination. The system's presence or absence of distributed generation sources is unpredictable, and these unknown factors change the equipment's operation time and disrupt the recloser-fuse synchronization. Constraints connected to diverse types of connection of distributed generating sources in the coordination problem have been considered in this paper to address this issue. The protective equipment settings and the fault current limiter are calculated simultaneously in the proposed technique, coordination between the recloser-fuse would be complete and reduced recloser and fuse operating time and fault current limiter cost. The problem has been solved through the use of an analytical optimization method. The suggested method is used to a sample network to determine the best fault current limiter and protection settings while taking uncertainty into account.},

The {DER} can change the direction and shape of the fault current, and in the protection system can cause selectivity failures. Particularly, coordination among reclosers, sectionalizers, and fuses is affected, with possible loss of coordination. Selectivity of a typical protection system is studied, using time-current methodology, and the "specific energy versus time" as an additional tool. The advantage of coordination through this methodology is that the protection is immune to fault current variability, allowing coordination between micro-processed devices and fuses. Modeled example is presented using {MatLab} Simulink, simulating a typical feeders. It is concluded that the incorporation of the specific-energy in the coordination studies, provide a powerful tool allowing the analysis of the coexistence of modern micro-processed protections with traditional ones.},

Typically, these protection strategies are developed prior to the entry of distributed resources into the distribution system. On the other hand, distributed resource usage in distribution systems affects the magnitude and direction of fault currents. These modifications may cause a breakdown in the coordination of recloser fuse protection schemes. The purpose of this work is to develop a new indicator for examining the effect of distributed source injection current on recloser fuse coordination disruption. The new index evaluates the effect of dispersed resources on the system's overall performance on the basis of network protection. To evaluate the suggested method's efficiency and performance, an {IEEE} 33-bus test system was employed, and the influence of distributed sources on the fuse-recloser protection of this system was evaluated under various scenarios.},

	abstract = {The automated fault location, isolation, and service restoration ({FLISR}) solution for the radial distribution network with distribution generation ({DG}), based on a centralized control structure, is proposed in this paper. This {FLISR} technique allows for enhanced coordination of reclosers and sectionalizers already present for protection or sectionalization purposes on the distribution network. The number of trip counters of reclosers and sectionalizers during the fault is used to identify the fault location. After locating a fault segment, the {FLISR} central controller will send the command to specific sectionalizers to isolate the fault from the other parts. The {DG} can be re-connected to operate in either grid-connected or island mode to support the service restoration process. The decision to reconnect the {DG} depends on the switch statuses after the fault is isolated. The purposed {FLISR} method is applied in the rural micro grid system consisting of a radial distribution network with a small-scale synchronous generator. The test system includes two reclosers and four sectionalizers which all of them can communicate with the {FLISR} central controller. The performances of automated {FLISR} operation in various fault locations are investigated using {RMSsimulation} on {DIgSILENT} {PowerFactory} software. The results show that using the information from trip counters and switch status, the rural microgrid system can effectively perform the {FLISR} process, improving network reliability.},

All nowadays applied advanced devices and previous solution scenarios are discussed and summarized through a critical literature review. The detailed methodology for the fusesaver coordinated implementation is explained. The evaluation can be achieved by calculating in a historical way the most common distribution system reliability indices, then a comparison between the case study results before and after fusesaver installation is presented. As a result, an enormous reduction occurred in outage frequency and duration, and the number of affected customers. Moreover, online monitoring of the line helped in estimating fault location and giving precise control decisions.},

	abstract = {Utilities are installing advanced distribution management systems ({ADMS}) around the globe to improve the sensing and control of distribution systems. {ADMS} is becoming a critical component to improve the resiliency and reliability of distribution systems. These management systems host a multitude of applications that can be used to sense, control, and operate distribution systems. Fault location, isolation, and service restoration ({FLISR}) is one of the {ADMS} applications that is critical to improving resilience during fault conditions. {FLISR} applications use smart, controllable devices that are installed in the distribution system for {FLISR} operation. These controllable devices include distributed energy resources ({DER}) and reclosers. Evaluating such {ADMS} applications before installation in the ﬁeld can help de-risk the ﬁeld implementation and avoid costly failures in the ﬁeld. This paper presents a background on experimental setup that are typically used to evaluate {ADMS} applications. This is followed by brieﬂy presenting the setup used to evaluate the {FLISR} application in an off-the-shelf {ADMS} tool. Finally, results from the evaluation experiments are presented.},

As part of the replacement, they expected to solve these problems as well as reap the anticipated benefits of adding microprocessor-based relaying, including event reports, sequence of events recording, metering, and communication. What they did not expect to encounter was that, although the settings were the same as those used previously, several of the reclosers tripped on the fast curve due to inrush conditions. Adding the microprocessor-based relays made {MCEC} aware of this problem, which presumably existed all along. {MCEC} did not have the capability to detect the problem previously. After this discovery, {MCEC} engineers gathered event reports to allow them to characterize the inrush. This paper discusses those inrush events and ways to overcome undesired tripping on distribution feeders on inrush conditions using both settings changes and second-harmonic blocking.},

	abstract = {Different technologies and resources are utilized to provide electricity access for the rural population around the world. Single wire earth return ({SWER}) line gets prominent attention around the globe to electrify low load profile customers and remote load like telecom base stations by extending from the nearby medium grid. {SWER} distribution system is designed by tapping from medium voltage distribution line using an isolation transformer. Unlike other distribution systems, the secondary side of a transformer has an only single line with dedicated perfect grounding system. {SWER} lines are considered as a cost-effective solution, compared to the threephase grid extension by electric utility companies. Since line route is mostly in rural areas with different geographical topologies, natural and human-made faults are inevitable scenarios on the line. According to a preference of utilities and geographical locations, {SWER} lines are equipped with overcurrent relay, surge arrestors or reclosers to isolate faulty line during the fault. The two main challenges on {SWER} line protection are to back up existing overcurrent protection relay when it fails to clear the fault and to locate the location of fault for line maintenance. Technicians patrol up to hundreds of km along {SWER} line to locate a fault. This activity will be inefficient and time-consuming way of locating the fault. In this paper, we model and simulate the impedance distance relay to back up existing protection system and locate the fault. Our model successfully backs up definite time overcurrent ({DTOC}) relay for a single line to ground ({SLG}) faults across the line. Consequently, fault locator-block locates the faulty line position.},

Oilﬁelds commonly have large concentrated loads separated by thousands of feet. To minimize line losses, medium-voltage power is distributed and stepped down at the point of use. In addition to common load ﬂow analysis and protection coordination, transformers, surge arresters, and grounding connections are important considerations for reliable production operations. Recloser settings typical for residential distribution cause major damage to submersible pumps. In remote areas where long neutral wires are necessary, solidly grounded power contributes to equipment failure but is nevertheless necessary for safety in surface equipment. The corner-grounded delta connection eliminates the neutral wire and is often used by rural utilities, despite its dangers. High-voltage three-wire construction can cause ferroresonance. Grounding inﬂuences the effectiveness of lightning and switching surge protection.},

The {DER} can change the direction and shape of the fault current, and in the protection system can cause selectivity failures. Particularly, coordination among reclosers, sectionalizers, and fuses is affected, with possible loss of coordination. Selectivity of a typical protection system is studied, using time-current methodology, and the "specific energy versus time" as an additional tool. The advantage of coordination through this methodology is that the protection is immune to fault current variability, allowing coordination between micro-processed devices and fuses. Modeled example is presented using {MatLab} Simulink, simulating a typical feeders. It is concluded that the incorporation of the specific-energy in the coordination studies, provide a powerful tool allowing the analysis of the coexistence of modern micro-processed protections with traditional ones.},

	abstract = {The automated fault location, isolation, and service restoration ({FLISR}) solution for the radial distribution network with distribution generation ({DG}), based on a centralized control structure, is proposed in this paper. This {FLISR} technique allows for enhanced coordination of reclosers and sectionalizers already present for protection or sectionalization purposes on the distribution network. The number of trip counters of reclosers and sectionalizers during the fault is used to identify the fault location. After locating a fault segment, the {FLISR} central controller will send the command to specific sectionalizers to isolate the fault from the other parts. The {DG} can be re-connected to operate in either grid-connected or island mode to support the service restoration process. The decision to reconnect the {DG} depends on the switch statuses after the fault is isolated. The purposed {FLISR} method is applied in the rural micro grid system consisting of a radial distribution network with a small-scale synchronous generator. The test system includes two reclosers and four sectionalizers which all of them can communicate with the {FLISR} central controller. The performances of automated {FLISR} operation in various fault locations are investigated using {RMSsimulation} on {DIgSILENT} {PowerFactory} software. The results show that using the information from trip counters and switch status, the rural microgrid system can effectively perform the {FLISR} process, improving network reliability.},

	abstract = {There is a problem of ensuring sufficient sensitivity of current relay protection in distribution networks 6-10 {kV}. Features of overhead distribution networks 6-10 {kV} are the reasons for the insufficient sensitivity of current protection: the use of steel and steel-aluminum wires of small sections, the long length of overhead lines of distribution networks, the remoteness of small power supplies. All these factors affect the magnitude of the short circuit current at the most remote point of the line of the main zone, while the short circuit currents are close in magnitude to the currents of the maximum mode, which leads to an overestimation of the relay operation current and, as a result, insufficient sensitivity not only in the zone protection redundancy, but also in the main protection zone. The article considers a device that has increased sensitivity during two-phase short circuits, compared with devices that respond both to a decrease in the mains voltage and to a change in the negative sequence voltage. The device consists of a number of blocks that perform the following functions: signal inversion, signal multiplication of two input line-to-line voltages, a direct current component extraction unit, a minimum value extraction unit from three input signals. The simulation results showed the advantage of the proposed method for increasing the sensitivity of current protection.},

	abstract = {Rural distribution systems, especially in developing countries, tend to be less reliable than urban distribution systems because customers are (1) located remotely and (2) connected to weak aerial networks with radial topologies without redundancy. To improve reliability in rural areas, microgrids ({MGs}) are being integrated into conventional power systems. This study evaluates the effect on the reliability of rural distribution systems when {MGs} are introduced considering different penetration levels for renewable and nonrenewable distributed generation, and under rated power of energy storage. Here, we ﬁrst formulate a reliability model for a rural distribution system with {MGs}. Based on this model, an interactive method using a sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is proposed and applied to calculate different conventional reliability indices. We show that this approach facilitates the selection of the parameters of the different systems constituting the {MGs} in order to comply with a predeﬁned reliability objective. For instance, by introducing only photovoltaic distributed generation systems to the rural distribution systems under study, achieving the reliability objective is next to impossible. However, when correctly dimensioned-hybrid {MGs} are introduced, such an objective is successfully achieved. In the future, our model and the results provided herein could be combined with technical and economic studies to obtain an optimal solution that meets a certain reliability objective.},
